## Introduction

The Banned Books Pipeline aims to provide a structured approach to collecting and analyzing data on banned books. With the rise of censorship in literature, it is crucial to document and understand the trends and reasons behind these bans. This project uses a combination of technologies to create a seamless ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process.

## Features

- **Data Scraping**: Automatically scrapes data from PEN America.
- **Data Storage**: Stores the data in a PostgreSQL database.
- **Data Transformation**: Cleans and formats the data for analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Provides visual insights using Streamlit.
- **Scheduled Runs**: Uses Airflow to schedule and manage ETL tasks.

## Technologies Used

- **Airflow**: For orchestrating the ETL pipeline.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **PostgreSQL**: For storing the scraped data.
- **Streamlit**: For creating interactive data visualizations.
- **Python**: The primary programming language for the project.
- **Neon**: A cloud-native PostgreSQL service for data storage.

## Installation

   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up PostgreSQL**:
   Ensure you have PostgreSQL installed and running. Create a database for the project.

5. **Configure Airflow**:
   Initialize Airflow and set up your DAGs.

6. **Run the Pipeline**:
   Follow the instructions in the `docs` folder to run the ETL pipeline.

## Usage

To use the Banned Books Pipeline, execute the following command:

```bash
airflow dags trigger banned_books_pipeline
```

This command will start the ETL process, scraping data from PEN America and storing it in your PostgreSQL database.
